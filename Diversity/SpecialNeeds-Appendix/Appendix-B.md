## **Appendix B: **Responding to Accessibility Requests 

This section lists important accessibility details about a conference, organized according to the different accessibility requests that are most often made.  Gathering this information and making it available online in advance will allow potential attendees to decide whether the conference will be accessible to them, and make it much easier for any student volunteer or conference organizer to respond to new accessibility requests as they come in, or unexpected situations during the conference itself. Once you have gathered this information, use the [SIGACCESS Accessibility FAQ Generator][1] to create a FAQ for the conference web site.

**If the suggestions in this document are followed, by the time attendees start to register, the conference should be ready to gracefully accommodate most requests. Communicate directly with a person making an accessibility request to clarify their needs.**

### **If someone requests Sign Language Interpretation:**

* Check which sign language they are requesting. Different countries have different languages.
    * If you have attendees requesting different sign languages, discuss whether a captioning service would meet their needs.
* ACM conference support staff can help in locating sign language interpretation and captioning companies.
* For sign language interpretation, the service will send several interpreters to the conference, who will work in shifts to translate the conference sessions and conversations at social events.  The fee may include accommodation costs, or the conference may provide accommodation directly.

### **If someone requests wheelchair or scooter access, they may need to know:**

* Details of wheelchair accessibility at the venue and hotel(s), including:

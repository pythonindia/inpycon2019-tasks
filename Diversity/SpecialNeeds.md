The below are mostly derived (or in some cases reproduced ) http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/ . It is a well researched and written out guideline on how to accomodate attendees with special needs. I have added a few comments and a few extra ideas and tried to make it less verbose. 

* During registration, allow participants to specify if they have disabilities. It can be an open ended suggestion like 
* - If you have a disability and require assistance, please inform (planner) by attaching your requirements to this form or call (planner & their contact information.)
* or 
* - A detailed form as illustrated at https://eoo.uga.edu/disability-services/planning-accessible-meetings-events
* Volunteers/Office Bearers should be sensitivised to the needs of the Physically Challenged and NeuralDivergents. 
    + Never assume that they need help. Always ask if they need help before assisting.
    + Specifically, staff should be available to show blind attendees  around to familiarize them with the layout. They should also be prepared to show attendees how to get to the meeting rooms. Make staff aware that Deaf attendees may communicate in different ways. Some may speak, others may write.
    

* You should think of this as an introduction to conference accessibility, at best. There are many disabled consultants you can hire to improve your conference, and I highly recommend you do that! They will be able to help you on a much deeper, professional level, and deserve compensation for their time. 

* If possible, they should be given the dedicated contact number to call in case of any need or issue.


## General Venue Accessibility
* Is the building wheelchair accessible through the main entrance?
* Large, open public spaces with few landmarks are difficult to navigate without vision.
* Are the elevators accessible? (Ask about tactile buttons, auditory feedback, visual feedback, wheelchair-height controls). 
* How easy is the space to navigate without vision? Large, open public spaces with few landmarks are difficult. Obstacle-free environments (free of protruding objects and trip hazards) are ideal. 
* Are doorways and important routes at least 32 inches wide? 
* Does the venue have alternative emergency devices for Deaf and hard of hearing guests?
* Is the venue free from strong sensory stimuli: smells (smoke, chlorine, perfume); loud areas (piped music, gambling machines); or flashing/bright lights that could be problematic for attendees with sensory sensitivity, or health conditions?
* Check each day of the conference that all disabled access doors are unlocked all day.
* Are there rooms that can be set aside as a quiet place for an attendee to rest, or a place to decompress?
* In a large conference center, provide clear signage and places to rest when trying to get from one room to another, helpful for physically disabled or chronically ill people.
* Make sure there are volunteer or staff guides available to give directions and/or read posters to blind and low vision attendees. 
* Does the venue have Braille labeling, especially in elevators? (Braille labels for elevators could be added by conference organizers.)
* Have the venue staff had any disability awareness training?
* How willing are the venue staff to accommodate special requests?

## Accessibility of the conference meeting spaces
* How much walking is required to get between the nearest disabled parking space, the lobby, guest rooms, meeting rooms, nearest restrooms and lunch location? What is the wheelchair route between these locations?
* Are there accessible restrooms near the meeting rooms, on the same level or with an elevator very near? Is there an automatic door? The accessible stall should accommodate a large power wheelchair.
* If there is a raised stage in the meeting room, is there a way for a wheelchair user to get to the podium? Are there railings on steps up to the stage?
* Is there an aisle leading upto the podium accessible on wheelchair?
* Do the meeting rooms have an induction loop?
* - For people like me who have never heard of induction loop
* + An induction or hearing loop system transmits an audio signal directly into a hearing aid via a magnetic field. This greatly reduces background noise, competing sounds, reverberation and other acoustic distortions that reduce clarity of sound.
* + src: https://www.ampetronic.co/info-centre/hearing-loop-basics/how-do-loops-work/
* Will there be room to seat wheelchair users in the meeting sessions?
* A few seats in the front and back rows of each session room should be reserved for people with disabilities, poeple on wheelchairs, pregnant women, deaf and hard of hearing audience members or other people who need easy access to seating.  Volunteers will need to mark or reserve these seats, so they are not accidentally used by nondisabled attendees who could sit elsewhere.
* leave some spaces open for wheelchair users in the front



## Accessibility of the hotel rooms
As we will not be providing accomodation, we may suggest hotels that have these options for people who communicate to us that they have disabilities.
* Some attendees may need to reserve a wheelchair accessible room, a room on the ground floor, or a room near an elevator. Is the hotel willing to hold these specific rooms for conference attendees to book, and does their reservation system allow attendees to specify these rooms?
* Are there at least 2 wheelchair accessible guest rooms? Specific adaptations include easily operable door handles and room keys, lowered spyhole and light switches, and room to maneuver bulky electric wheelchairs.
* Can the accessible rooms accommodate two beds? (Sometimes people bring an assistant or family with them, and don’t want to have to pay for two rooms.)
* If the event is more than one day, is there a wheelchair-adapted room with a roll-in shower?
* Does the hotel have hoists available? If so, how many, and do guests need to bring their own slings?

## Accessibility of dining arrangements and catering
If we are not able to implement the below suggestions, at the best, we can provide an FAQ online on what type of food to expect at the venue, so attendees can make their own arrangements if they need.
* During buffet, have servers/volunteers available to assist; buffets can be particularly difficult for persons with mobility or visual impairments.
* Can the caterers that work with the venues accommodate special meal requests?  (Vegetarian, Vegan, Low Salt, Kosher, Halal, Gluten Free, other allergies).  
* + If yes, Can the venue prepare gluten free and allergy sensitive food without cross contamination?  
* + If not will the conference be allowed to make alternate arrangements with a supplementary caterer?  
* + It is helpful to have a system (e.g. colored stickers on the conference badges) to identify people who have requested special meals, if these meals are served separately by hotel staff
* Ask the hotel to provide labels on buffet dishes listing ingredients or indicating the presence of gluten/meat/dairy products/fish.
* Make sure that non-sugar beverage and healthy snack options are available
* Ask the catering staff to make drinking straws available
* Try to place any buffet in a blocked off area with clear aisles so low-mobility users can select their own food without fear of getting knocked over.
* Communicate as early as possible in the website accessibility FAQ if the conference can not meet these requirements, so individuals can decide whether they can attend the conference.

## Available AV
* When choosing and costing the AV, bear in mind that speakers with physical disabilities may find a lapel mic more convenient to use than a podium or handheld mic. Also consider adjustable height podiums, and chairs for participants who cannot stand for long periods of time.  
* For attendees who wish to ask questions, having a volunteer bring a roving mic to them can be more accessible than going to a standing mic.
* Make sure there is a connection into the PA for laptops, and microphones set up in the room for the speakers and for audience questions.
* Always use a microphone, even if you think you don’t need it, you have a loud voice, or it’s a small crowd.
Prepare both digital and printed versions of conference material. Digital materials are more accessible to blind and low vision attendees (for use with screen readers), and printed materials can help people with ADHD or learning disabilities follow along more easily.

## Budget
* Captioning and sign language translation are expensive. Sign language interpretation should include coverage of breaks and social events. The choice of whether to provide interpreters or captioning will depend on the requests made by attendees. For conferences where there will be attendees who sign in different sign languages, captioning can be used to accommodate everyone with a single service. For multi-track conferences, if there are several attendees requesting sign language, consider allowing for two sets of sign language interpreters.
* The audio-visual budget should include microphones for speakers, and for asking questions. Together with an induction loop, this helps people who are hard of hearing to participate fully.
* When deciding how many volunteers are needed, consider that volunteer duties might include assisting attendees with accessibility requests, such as guiding people to the restrooms or helping at a buffet.
* Some attendees may require helpers or assistants to accompany them at the conference for caregiving and/or language interpreting. These helpers should not have to pay the full conference fee. A suggested alternative is to have them pay for a ‘meal-only’ fee if they will be eating at the conference.

## Website
* The conference website should meet W3C’s WCAG 2.0 accessibility guidelines and be tested for usability when fonts are enlarged, when style sheets are turned off, when images are turned off, and without using a pointing device (keyboard-only access). Testing with a screen reader and screen magnifier is also beneficial.
* The website should offer information on how to create an accessible submission to the technical program. For example, follow the SIGACCESS guidelines for accessible conference submissions.
* The website should provide information about conference accessibility so that a disabled person can decide whether it is safe to attend.  SIGACCESS provides an FAQ page generator that can be used to generate a suitable accessibility FAQ page for the conference website. This information should be available when the call for papers is released.  It is very important that this page accurately describes both the limitations and the capabilities of the conference.  It should include:
* How and when to notify the conference about accessibility needs.
* Accessibility of the venue(s), including the conference venue, hotels, and offsite locations.
* Transportation. For people who use bulky electric wheelchairs, for example, accessible taxis, presence of curb cuts, distances and steepness of streets are all important.
* Details of local accessibility information services, and contact people at the conference.  
* The website should provide details and advance registration for social events to facilitate access for those who are not able to see onsite notices.


Local Arrangements

* Create a triage plan for accessibility problems that may arise during the conference.  Make sure major organizers (General Chairs, Logistics, Registration, volunteers, etc) have contact information for an Accessibility Chair or other responsible person who can make arrangements for accommodations, and know which of the venue staff should be contacted.
* Gather information on local emergency doctors, hospital facilities, wheelchair repair, physiotherapist and veterinarians (for service animals).  Given Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine can be incompatible, especially in terms of medications, provide contact information for different medical traditions as appropriate given the venue.
* For single-track conferences, offer an orientation session before the conference, for attendees and presenters to get to know the meeting room layout and seating arrangements as they will be laid out during the meeting.  For multi-track conferences, where layouts may be changed dynamically throughout the event, the layout information should be available for attendees or the Accessibility Chair in advance.
* Make volunteers available to attendees who request assistance.
* If the conference provides an attendee list, have an electronic version available for reference at the registration desk, so that visually impaired attendees can browse the list for people they may wish to talk with. An alternative is to have attendees ask at the registration desk whether specific people are present.


Conference Sessions

* In advance of the conference, communicate expectations to attendees that will help to make the conference more accessible and safer for all. An example statement is provided in Appendix C.
* In advance of the sessions, presenters should be encouraged to prepare as accessible a presentation as possible, including captions for video. If presentations can be made available ahead of time, this is very helpful to attendees with visual impairment, captioners and sign language interpreters.
* The printed session schedule should also be available electronically, in large print, and if possible Braille (1 Braille copy is sufficient).
* At the start of the conference, if there are attendees in the audience with vision impairments, remind presenters that all slides, videos and visual demos will need to be described as part of the spoken presentation. Session chairs can help re-enforce this.
* Remind the audience to use a microphone to ask questions, so that everyone can hear, and should state their name before speaking, for the benefit of those who cannot see who is speaking.  volunteers should be present to take microphones to audience members with limited mobility who have questions.
* If there is an interpreter or captioner present, the lighting should be good enough that they can be easily seen by the deaf attendee(s). Explain to presenters that they should speak with a normal tone and pace, unless asked to slow down by the interpreter. For personal conversations, the attendees should be reminded to speak directly to the person, not to the interpreter.
* A presenter with a visual impairment may request assistance from a volunteer to advance slides. The session chair, or a volunteer, can also facilitate question asking.
* Presenters/Speakers should be given extra time to walk across the stage, or someone with cerebral palsy a few extra minutes to give their talk.  Session chairs should have information about participants with disabilities in advance if possible.
* Volunteers should enforce clear walkways and promote awareness during sessions
* After a session, conference attendees should be encouraged to keep the walkways clear and ensure there is a path for people to exit the room.

Proceedings

* Work with the proceedings publishers to ensure that the index and table of contents of the electronic proceedings are available in an accessible format. If they are html, the W3C WCAG 2.0 guidelines apply. For pdf documents, the Adobe Acrobat accessibility check applies (see resources below for more information about creating accessible pdf documents).
* Work with the proceedings chairs to ensure that accepted conference submissions are made accessible. The publishers Sheridan can also help with this if requested.
* Encourage authors to caption videos that will be released by the conference.

## Social Activities

The social side of a conference is equally as important as the technical content. Try to avoid events that exclude some attendees. Consider whether:

* The event will have broad appeal (e.g not purely visual or auditory, not excessively loud, not visually intense)
* Accessible transportation is available to any off-site events
* Offsite venues (e.g. restaurants) are wheelchair and scooter accessible with an accessible restroom. Will aisles still be accessible with all of the planned attendees present?
* Sign language interpretation is available for the social event.
* Participants will need to be informed of the walking distance to nearby events, so they can decide how best to get there. Also whether the walking route is wheelchair accessible (flat enough with curb cuts).
* Stools or chairs are available for people who are unable to stand, or for people who want to converse face-to-face with colleagues in wheelchairs or scooters.  These should be spread throughout the event space.
* A quiet place is reserved where people can gather for social conversation, for people who are hard of hearing or who find the main area overstimulating.
* Notification should be given in advance if social events will include flashing lights and noises, which can trigger seizures.
